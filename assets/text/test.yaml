                        Mart should have made a dead drop two weeks ago, which is before his last message. It should be in a green card cylinder, marked 'Sour Cream and Chives'. Hopefully, it's still there. 
                        
                        The address is
                                98th Winston Ave,
                                Chillcot,
                                94134 San Fransisco

                        You'll want to be careful, since it's possible that whoever got to Mart is watching his dead drops, hoping to catch someone. 
           
        consequences:
                - 'root.branch.knot'

#                There's no way this is going to work. You need to tell Angela - she's not listening to me. She's convinced that the only way we
#                stop this is by getting hooks into the local legislature. I keep telling her - there's no way we do that without getting
#                noticed. And once we get noticed, we're done.
