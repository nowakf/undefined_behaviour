ALTERNATE HISTORY:

Lisp Machines:
In the lead-up to the 'second ai-winter' (1987), many companies were convinced that 'lisp machines', complex, purpose-built computers designed to run LISP, were going to lead to 'strong AI'.

Lisp machines were computers specifically designed to run 'lisp', a very high-level language notable for its massive over-use of parentheses, and its construction of programs through nested lists.
Using these machines, they attempted to create 'expert systems', complexes of rules that would, in theory, reproduce human judgement.
> I think there's an opportunity here to tie in the 'arrival of the old ones' with the real history of human attempts to produce intelligence.

> AI, as it stands today, is generally discussed in Lovecraftian terms - the irrationality, non-comprehensibility, and mysteriousness of neural nets, are bandied as selling points,  proof of their exceptional power to solve problems.[^0]

Xanadu:
Xanadu was the quintessential vapourware - a project spanning four decades, which pioneered a lot of the ideas (for example, hyperlinks) that went into the early web. It resulted in nothing.
	
What Kind of Future?
	
There are plenty of opportunities here to use technology history to construct a sort of alternate future - one where LISP machines actually worked, where IBM won out against Microsoft, and so on. 




[^0]: It's notable here that experts typically describe these characteristics as the main failing of machine learning approaches - brittleness, and difficulty of debugging, respectively.
		
This helped a lot! Thank you!!
