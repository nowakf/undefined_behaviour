So:

You have spells.
These spells have exp,
Elemental types? (or equivalent)
Abilities
Evolutionary progression

There is a network of actors. 
	White names are those to which you have direct access.
	Grey names you do not.
	Red names denote known enemies.
	Blue names denote known allies.
	
You have stats.
	INT: determines your spell exp gain.
	WILL: determines your spell distortion.
	(Subtracted from spell exp)
	CHA: determines your diplomatic options.
	SANITY: (essentially HP)

Defeating enemies gives you access to their spells.

(So how do you go about programming this?)

Something like: 

Renderer: 
	Two panels - left is objects, right is methods + info.
	In the middle is a spell-bar.
	At the bottom is a mode switcher. (TAB CHANGES MODE)

	Views:  
		Mode		Left		Middle		Right

		News ticker 	Titles		Distort		Article content  
		Spellbook	Spells		SColor		Description
		Social		Network(?)	Nil		Agent description + List of possible actions
		Stts + Abs 	Stats		PColor		Abilities

	View Contains: 
	List of Buttons,
	List of Text boxes.
	GameController
	Cursor?

	So, this will mean:
	Renderer classes:
		Button
		   
		Network

		Text box

		colorBar

Control schema:

	J + K or UP + DOWN increment or decrement the list. Letters select branches in the network tree. 

Social mode:
						        		      /`Something else
		Entry Somethign --(a)	      		(c)-- Somewhat Something--Something else
				     \	     	      /			      \_Something else
				      \	             /				 /``Something else
	     Somebody somebody--(b)--  Alson Beric   --(d)-- Julius Simpleton-- Something else
					  	     \		  		 \__Something else
					    	      \			
					      	       (e)--   Alex Grovenor   -	

So then, how do you write this?

Horizontal split:
Left: relationship viewer,
Right, central figure viewer.

Selected Node. 
Make images* with points that you can attatch text to, then on focus change, translate* to the selected node, then fade.
Then show the same image, just with different text entries. 
*Six images, 

So, image translates to new node. Then link images disappear. Then link images reappear in order.

Maybe some way to check path between two figures? Probably too much work to implement.

*Step speed should be one per line. 


GaameController:
	Gets world/player state, returns it to view.
	Has currentSelection.
	Has some kind of input method?.
			

World:
	Network,
	Player,
	Distortion level.

	METHODS:
		Getnews (which takes the distortion level)

Network:
	List of actors.
	Dictionary of relationships. (Or something? maybe a struct?)

	METHODS:
		ChangeActorState()

News Ticker:
	News file,
	News state,


Spell book:
	Dictionary of spells. (With state known/unknown)

	METHODS:
		ChangeState()

Player:
	INT: int,
	WILL: "
	CHA: "
	SANITY:
	HP: 
	Dictionary of known actors,
	Spell book.

	METHODS:
		DoSpell(spell/ability)
		CreatePlayer()
		AddWILL(int)
		AddCHA(int)
		AddSAN(int)
		AddHP(int)
		LoseWill(int)
		LoseCHA(int)
		LoseSAN(int)
		LoseHP(int)
		AddActor(Actor)

Spell:
	Exp counter,
	Abilities,
	Distortion multiplier.
	Progression.
	SpellColors

	METHODS:
		Render()
		LearnSpell()
		Progress()

Actor:
	INT, WILL, CHA, allegiance, available spells, SANITY.

	METHODS:
		NewActor()
		ChangeAllegiance()
		Update() - this would include what the actor does in a given 'tick'

Ability:
	Distortion cost.
	EXP gain.
	
	METHODS:
		Has a method that effects SANITY/HP, variably gated by stats. (So you essentially call spell.do(player, target). Spell then increments exp. Target is updated, player is updated, world is updated. 

		This method would also have some other effect? Allegiance change?
