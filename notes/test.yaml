                Mart should have made a dead drop two weeks ago, which is
                before his last message. It should be in a green card cylinder,
                marked 'Sour Cream and Chives'. Hopefully, it's still there.

                The address is
                        98th Winston Ave,
                        Chillcot,
                        94134 San Fransisco

                You'll want to be careful, since it's possible that whoever
                got to Mart is watching his dead drops, hoping to catch someone.

        consequences:
