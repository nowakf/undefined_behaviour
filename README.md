This is the groundwork for Undefined Behaviour.

*"The terms unspecified behavior, undefined behavior, and implementation-defined behavior are used to categorize the result of writing programs whose properties the Standard does not, or cannot, completely describe."*
	-ANSI C rationale

*“strange, beetling, table-like constructions suggesting piles of multitudinous rectangular slabs or circular plates or five-pointed stars”*
	-At the Mountains of Madness



 *" Undefined behavior -- behavior, upon use of a nonportable or erroneous program construct, ... for which the standard imposes no requirements.  Permissible undefined behavior ranges from ignoring the situation completely with unpredictable results, to having demons fly out of your nose."*
	 -comp.std.c
